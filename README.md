# WordCloud-for-peptide-sequences
Each peptide sequence is displayed with font size proportional to its frequency in the dataset. The more frequent a peptide, the larger it appears in the word cloud.
This visualization helps to quickly identify the most frequent peptides in the dataset. It can be helpful for understanding peptide distribution and identifying dominant sequences in peptidomics experiment.

You can customize the following:
1. Change colors list to use a different color palette.
2. Adjust relative_scaling to control how much bigger frequent peptides appear.
3. Modify the mask shape by changing the create_circular_mask function.
4. For the enhanced version, you could use other properties like isoelectric point or molecular weight.
