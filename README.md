WordCloud for peptide sequences

## Description

Each peptide sequence is displayed with font size proportional to its frequency in the dataset. The more frequent a peptide, the larger it appears in the word cloud. This visualization helps to quickly identify the most frequent peptides in the dataset. It can be helpful for understanding peptide distribution and identifying dominant sequences in peptidomics experiments.
